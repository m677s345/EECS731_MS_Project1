# EECS731_MS_Project1
This is the repository for the first project of KU's EECS-731
In this project we are tasked with the creation of this github page along with selecting three datasets and formulating two ideas on how the datasets can be combined to add additional value.


The data sets were from the agriculture industry and taken from the USDA. Heavy modification was made to the raw data to make them useable in Python specifically with the pandas packages. I mainly focused on the beef production as a function of temperature. I trimmed the datasets to include only beef data before importing them to my notebook. Both the cleaned and the raw data is available for you in the data branch. The main edit to the data was the formation of the date/period column so it can be read nicely in python.
