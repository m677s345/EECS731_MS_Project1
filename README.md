# EECS731_MS_Project1
This is the repository for the first project of KU's EECS-731
In this project we are tasked with the creation of this github page along with selecting three datasets and formulating two ideas on how the datasets can be combined to add additional value.

Two datasets were chosen to determine The frequency of seasonal changes in the price of beef production. Monthly data on average temperature across the US paired with average beef prices among several different catagories of slaughter beef was used. The dataset was trimmed to fit the goals of the project. The dataset contained information on all meat sales across the US and that was trimmed to only include beef and was later trimmed to contain only steer beef. Columns such as the price per hundered pounds and other nonessential headers were removed/condenced in both the average temperature data and the livestock data to allow for better integration into pandas dataframes.
